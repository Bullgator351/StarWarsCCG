Star Wars CCG

This game was published by Decipher from 1995 to 2001.

Status:

In progress:


1.) Re-creating all proxies in 88x88 format with transparent areas so sideways cards will display correctly.
2.) Concurrent with this - separate frames from border to facilitate adding white bordered cards without doubling the number of proxies.
3.) Completing PremiereUnlimited.o8c

To be tackled before release:

1.) Adjust Location:Site proxies to make text more readable.
2.) Acquisition of Premiere Limited set and creation of PremiereLimited.o8c
